### Agenda

Brainstorm ideas for our fortune telling app

### Summary

Decided to create an app with multiple fortune telling sub apps. The idea is for there to be a home page displaying all of the available fortune telling apps that have been developed by our group. These apps are supposed to be standalone applications (like the 8 ball site). For now we are planning on implementing 3 classic fortune telling methods, but in the digital form: a fortune cookie, zodiac compatibility decider, and a palm reader. To accomplish this, we will split our group into subgroups and assign 2-3 people to each app (and another 2-3 for developing the main page). If time permits, we plan on meeting in the later weeks to add 1-2 more discrete apps to make the site more complete.

### Audience & Style:

As a group, we voted on the color scheme of the site. This can be found at the Miro link below along with other important aspects of the project discussed in the meeting.

We're also trying to develop the aesthetics of the site with a college student audience in mind. In our meeting we discussed the biggest issues with existing fortune telling apps and noted that all of them looked dated, inconsistent, and generally horrible. So to remedy this, we've decided to do the opposite and create a website with a modern design that is consistent and appeals to a younger student audience.

We also discussed using AI to generate any images/icons that need to be displayed on the site.

### Discarded ideas
We briefly discussed making a freemium app where users could pay to use all the fortune telling apps an unlimited number of times per day. This was discarded for adding extra complexity to the project.

Betting. There was brief mentioning of fortune telling apps involving betting (on some event in the future), but we decided this was not an appropriate feature to add considering our target audience.

#### Meeting finished at: 4pm*
